title: "MQTT: The Standard for IoT Messaging"
---


MQTT is an OASIS standard messaging protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT). It is designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport that is ideal for connecting remote devices with a small code footprint and minimal network bandwidth. MQTT today is used in a wide variety of industries, such as automotive, manufacturing, telecommunications, oil and gas, etc.


# Why MQTT?

## Lightweight and Efficient
MQTT clients are very small, require minimal resources so can be used on small microcontrollers. MQTT message headers are small to optimize network bandwidth.

## Bi-directional Communications
MQTT allows for messaging between device to cloud and cloud to device. This makes for easy broadcasting messages to groups of things.

## Scale to Millions of Things
MQTT can scale to connect with millions of IoT devices.

## Reliable Message Delivery
Reliability of message delivery is important for many IoT use cases. This is why MQTT has 3 defined quality of service levels: 0 - at most once, 1- at least once, 2 - exactly once

## Support for Unreliable Networks
Many IoT devices connect over unreliable cellular networks. MQTTâ€™s support for persistent sessions reduces the time to reconnect the client with the broker.

## Security Enabled
 
MQTT makes it easy to encrypt messages using TLS and authenticate clients using modern authentication protocols, such as OAuth.
